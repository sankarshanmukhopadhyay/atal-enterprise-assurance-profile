# Enterprise Role Model (Example)

Roles:
- Operator-of-Record (OOR)
- Approver-of-Record (AOR)
- Policy Owner
- Evidence Custodian
- Safety Kernel Operator

Separation patterns:
- OOR ≠ AOR for higher-risk actions
- Policy Owner ≠ Evidence Custodian where feasible
- L3: dual-control for kill-switch and high-impact policy changes
